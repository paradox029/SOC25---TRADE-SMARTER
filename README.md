# SOC25 TRADE SMARTER
The project so far has been very informative , engaging and interesting. We started by studying about technical analysis , which ranged all the way from simple candlestick patterns to indicators and more. Having gained a good amount of domain knowledge , we started learning about C++ and python , primarily the pandas library for data-driven workflows which we will be concerned with. 
We put the good base that we had established to practical use by completing two exciting assignments : 
  1. The first assignment included technical analysis that had to be done on a large cap company . The assignment was very engaging to the point we could apply all the theory to actual shares and markets , and actually see the theories            taking tangible form.
  2. In the second assignment we had to use python to build 3 technical indicators of our choice and then derive a strategy around them , in essence, use the various indicators to tell us when we should buy or sell a certain share.
Both the assignments have been included in this repository.
In the most recent week , we have started with the theory neural networks and how to implement them using pytorch.
